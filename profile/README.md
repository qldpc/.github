## qLDPC

This is an organization to organize projects around quantum error correcting codes that have low density parity checks (qLDPC)

Of particular interest:
- qLDPCs practical at experimentally accessible block lengths
- Experimental considerations for qLDPC like layout, emulating long range gates, etc
- Efficient decoders for qLDPCs
- Asymptotic constructions of qLDPCs
